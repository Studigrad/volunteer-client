The first rabies vaccination after the microchip is implanted is called the primary vaccination and it should be a one year vaccine unless manufacturer specifications permit its use as a primary vaccination. If your pet\'s previous rabies vaccination had expired before being revaccinated, the next vaccination becomes the primary vaccination. All vaccinations that are administered after the primary vaccination are called booster vaccinations. If your pet is entering Belgium from a rabies-free (click here) or rabies-controlled country (click here), the primary rabies vaccination must be administered no sooner than 21 days before entering Belgium. There is no waiting period after booster vaccinations as long as: Belgium does honor the 3 year rabies vaccination for dogs, cats and ferrets; however, it should only be administered as a booster, not as a primary vaccination. You can speak to your veterinarian about this. Once your pet has entered Belgium, a 21 day waiting period is not required for subsequent visits, provided rabies boosters are kept up to date, and the other entry requirements are met.

The first rabies vaccination after the microchip is implanted is called the primary vaccination and it should be a one year vaccine unless manufacturer specifications permit its use as a primary vaccination. If your pet\'s previous rabies vaccination had expired before being revaccinated, the next vaccination becomes the primary vaccination. All vaccinations that are administered after the primary vaccination are called booster vaccinations. If your pet is entering Denmark from a rabies-free (click here) or rabies-controlled country (click here), the primary rabies vaccination must be administered no sooner than 21 days before entering Denmark. There is no waiting period after booster vaccinations as long as: Denmark does honor the 3 year rabies vaccination for dogs, cats and ferrets; however, it should only be administered as a booster, not as a primary vaccination. You can speak to your veterinarian about this.

(Have your veterinarian scan your pet\'s microchip prior to the titer test.) Samples must be processed at approved laboratories. Assuming test results are within acceptable limits, your pet can enter Denmark no sooner than 3 calendar months after the date the blood was drawn.
